# career_preparation

This repository is meant to serve as a guide for data science students (in school or not) with information and tools to help with making career decisions.

# Todos:
  - Add resources for interview prep from Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Uber, Valve, OpenAI, Unity, etc.
  - Add resources for general skills for data and computer science
  - Implement common algorithms (max flow, djikstras, a*, binary search, etc) and analyze runtime, time complexity (big O) in at least two languages. I am thinking C++ and Python.
